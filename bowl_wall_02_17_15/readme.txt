There are three Geometry versions of the "bowl" wall here.
Each has a different UV map so you can select which model displays your footage the best.  An automatic switcher might be handy here but I suggest filling a bin with one of these three sizes:

2560x720, 1920x1080 or 1280x720

Then pipe the bin output to the model that matches (null before switch, which has a movieTest_reference image).  Make sure the Render TOPs are only rendering this particular model.

Cameras stay put.
Two 1280x720 renders are placed next to each other and finally a mask over this.  Final outout is 2560x720.
