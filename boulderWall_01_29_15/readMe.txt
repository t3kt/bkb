Hey Team,

Here is the final boulder 3D object file.

I've included the reference template.  UV maps are square but because this wall is so wide, I've stretched it five times wide (so it's 5x1).  Our resolution to the projectors will be 3840x720. That is really irrelevant in this stage. Keeping things close, I've made this template 3840x768, which is in the scale needed for this model.  We will be rendering movies later to match our projectors.  That said, use the imageReference picture to see how the UVx5_wide.jpg is mapped to it.  Notice the far right is cut off, that is because of the height (don't want the image to tile).  

2D artists: make a video project at 3840x768, place this png file in and have fun with it.

3D artists: use the model as you like.  We still need to figure out camera and wall locations if you'd like to do some rendering.  I will be working on an FBX file that should open in Maya and C4D.  Please let me know if you are using another package.

As always, ask me if you have any questions.
