imageReference jpg's display the moviefilein_3840 on top of the 3D model of the Boulder Wall.  

moviefilein_3840 has a resolution of 3840x720, and so do the combined_boulder_wallUVx5_wide images. 

Use the combined_boulder....png as a template over a 3840x720 movie or picture of your choice.  This will help you see where the wall parts are in relation to any lower editing layers.

Final renders do not have to be 3840x720 which is the max but should be the same aspect ratio which is 5.33:1
