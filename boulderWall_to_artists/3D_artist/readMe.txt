Here is the FBX scene file.  It has the boulder wall obj and three cameras that act as the viewer perspective.  Let me know if you can open these.  I've included three stills taken from each camera (I added a wire-frame to these pictures to help "visualize").  Each of your camera renders should look like these. 

Camera settings if you need them: 
Resolution: 1280x720
Focal Length: 50 (millimeters)
Aperture: 100

Once each camera is rendered, place them next to each other for a combined 3840x720 movie.  Please use supplied mask over the clips because the area around the walls must be black for Resolume to grab slices for output.
