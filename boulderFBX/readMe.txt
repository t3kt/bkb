Hey Team,

Here is a test FBX scene.  It has the boulder wall obj and three cameras that act as the viewer perspective.  Let me know if you can open these.  I've included three stills taken from each camera (I added a wire-frame to the model to help "visualize" it.  

Camera settings if you need them: 
Resolution: 1280x720
Focal Length: 50 (millimeters)
Aperture: 100
